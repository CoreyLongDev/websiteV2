// Complete rework

const About = () => {

    return (
        <div className="content">
            <h1 className="cooltext">That's Me, right?...wait</h1>
            <br />
            <p>This is a paragraph or so about me and the things i like and can do at the moment and that i am interested in.
                <br />
                also this is more about me in a sexcond paragraph
                <br />
                i wanted this to include at least three paragraphs so lets just see how this looks without using lame ipsom whatever it is.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default About;
